Version 1.2.0
-------------
2013 September 30

This version is recommend for all users, as it brings support for the release version of Handlebars.

* Updates to handlebars.rb 0.5.0, which brings with it the 1.0.0 release 
  version version of the JavaScript Handlebars, and an updated Ruby Racer (Ruby-JavaScript bridge).
  Thanks to [Yehuda Katz](https://github.com/wycats) and [Charles Lowell](https://github.com/cowboyd)
  for their continued work on Handlebars and Handlebars.rb, respectively.

* Backwards compatibility note: If you are using automatic partials loading 
  with an absolute path, you must now quote the path. For example:

		{{> "/the/path/to/partial" }}

	This is due to changes in the Handlebars parser.
